  * @brief   HAL time base based on the hardware RTC_ALARM Template.
  *
  *          This file override the native HAL time base functions (defined as weak)
  *          to use the RTC ALARM for time base generation:
  *           + Intializes the RTC peripheral to increment the seconds registers each 1ms
  *           + The alarm is configured to assert an interrupt when the RTC reaches 1ms 
  *           + HAL_IncTick is called at each Alarm event and the time is reset to 00:00:00
  *           + HSE (default), LSE or LSI can be selected as RTC clock source
