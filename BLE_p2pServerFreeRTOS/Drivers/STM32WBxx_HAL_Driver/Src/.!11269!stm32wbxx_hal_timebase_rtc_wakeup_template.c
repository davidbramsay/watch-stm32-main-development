  * @brief   HAL time base based on the hardware RTC_WAKEUP Template.
  *    
  *          This file overrides the native HAL time base functions (defined as weak)
  *          to use the RTC WAKEUP for the time base generation:
  *           + Intializes the RTC peripheral and configures the wakeup timer to be
  *             incremented each 1ms
  *           + The wakeup feature is configured to assert an interrupt each 1ms 
  *           + HAL_IncTick is called inside the HAL_RTCEx_WakeUpTimerEventCallback
  *           + HSE (default), LSE or LSI can be selected as RTC clock source
